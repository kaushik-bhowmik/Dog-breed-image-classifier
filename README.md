Abstract: As for humans also dog breed classification is a very difficult task. So, I tried to solve this problem by using deep learning method, in this project initially, I trained a model for solving the classification probelm as classification accuracy was low(15%) then I used transfer learning which significantly increased the classification accuracy to 75%.
The pipeline for this project:
1. Import Datasets
2. Detect images of humans 
3. Detect images of dogs
4. Create a CNN to classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
5. Create a CNN to classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
6. Test the algorithms for step 4 and step 5.
